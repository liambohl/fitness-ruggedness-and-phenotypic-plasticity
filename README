The goal of this project is to study the effects of phenotypic plasticity on the local fitness landscapes of well-adapted organisms.
Specific attributes of fitness landscapes to measure:
-distribution of fitness among mutants
-pleiotropy: the tendency of single mutations to affect more than one trait, where a trait is the expression of one task in one environment
-epistasis: the tendency of separate mutations to have interacting effects on an organism's phenotype

Steps in executing this project:
-run_list is submitted through dist_qsub to generate initial avida data.
	Output to ../data
-Avida is run in analyze mode with analyze.cfg to find the dominant genotype for each trial run.
	Output to ../analysis
-calc-mutant-fitness.py is run to generate specified mutants from dominants and evaluate their phenotype in each environment.
	Output to ../mutant-fitness
