The broad goal of this project is to study the effects of phenotypic plasticity on the ruggedness of local fitness landscapes
TODO: elaborate on more specific goals

Steps in executing this project:
-run_list is submitted through dist_qsub to generate initial avida data.
	Output to ../data
-Avida is run in analyze mode with analyze.cfg to find the dominant genome for each trial run.
	Output to ../analysis
-calc-mutant-fitness.py is run to generate all 1-step mutants and evaluate their phenotype in each environment.
	Output to ../mutant-fitness
-aggregate-mutant-fitness.py is run to generate summary stats of the phenotypes of n-step mutants in each environment.
	Output to ../mutant-fitness
